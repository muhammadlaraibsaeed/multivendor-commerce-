## [Project Structure](https://www.google.com/)

This Laravel project follows the standard directory structure for a Laravel application. Here's a brief overview of the folder and file structure:

### Folders

- **`app/`**: Contains the core application files.
  - **`Console/`**: Console commands.
  - **`Exceptions/`**: Exception handling and error handling.
  - **`Http/`**: Controllers, middleware, and requests.
  - **`Models/`**: Eloquent models.
  - **`Providers/`**: Service providers that bind services into the container.

- **`bootstrap/`**: Contains files for bootstrapping the application.
  - **`cache/`**: Stores framework-generated cache files (e.g., configuration and route cache).

- **`config/`**: Configuration files for various aspects of the application (e.g., `app.php`, `database.php`).

- **`database/`**: Database-related files.
  - **`factories/`**: Model factory definitions.
  - **`migrations/`**: Migration files for creating and modifying database tables.
  - **`seeders/`**: Seed classes for populating the database with test data.

- **`public/`**: Publicly accessible files like images, CSS, JavaScript, and the entry point `index.php`.

- **`resources/`**: Resources for the application.
  - **`views/`**: Blade template files.
  - **`lang/`**: Language files for localization.
  - **`sass/`**: SASS files for styling (optional, depending on the setup).

- **`routes/`**: Route definitions (e.g., `web.php`, `api.php`, `console.php`).

- **`storage/`**: Application storage files.
  - **`app/`**: Storage for application files.
  - **`framework/`**: Stores framework-generated files (e.g., cache, sessions).
  - **`logs/`**: Log files.

- **`tests/`**: Test files for unit and feature testing.

- **`vendor/`**: Third-party packages and dependencies installed via Composer.

### Files

- **`.env`**: Environment configuration file for sensitive settings like database credentials.
- **`artisan`**: CLI tool for running various Laravel commands.
- **`composer.json`**: Defines PHP dependencies and autoloading information.
- **`composer.lock`**: Records the exact versions of dependencies installed.
- **`package.json`**: Defines Node.js dependencies and scripts for frontend assets.
- **`phpunit.xml`**: Configuration file for PHPUnit testing.
- **`README.md`**: Markdown file with information about the project.

### Difference Between `composer.json` and `composer.lock`

- **`composer.json`**: 
  - **Purpose**: This file is used to define the dependencies required for your project, along with other configuration settings like autoloading and scripts. It specifies which packages and versions your project needs, but does not pin specific versions.
  - **Usage**: When you run `composer install` or `composer update`, Composer reads this file to determine which packages to install or update.
  
- **`composer.lock`**:
  - **Purpose**: This file locks the dependencies to specific versions that were installed at the time of the last update or installation. It ensures that every environment where your project is installed will have the exact same versions of dependencies.
  - **Usage**: The `composer.lock` file is created or updated automatically by Composer when you run `composer update`. It is used by Composer during `composer install` to ensure consistency across different installations.

This structure supports the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and allows for clean, maintainable code.
